¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

We'll be careful not to get

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Since you've destroyed 
Spiders of the Curse, the curse
is starting to weaken!
Did the kids who returned to
normal give you any rewards?
You should know that the only
way to become very rich is to
destroy as many Spiders of the
Curse as possible!
There are some tricks to finding
them all! First of all, you'll have
to hunt at night. Secondly, keep in
mind that they love soft soil...
Pay close attention to your
surroundings!
Please, we're counting on you!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
We look like this because of 
the spider's curse. But...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
We all look like this because of
the spider's curse.
If every Spider of the Curse in
the entire world were destroyed,
the curse would be broken.
When you destroy a Spider of the 
Curse, a token will appear. Collect
it as proof of your achievement.
The number next to this icon on
the Quest Status Subscreen 
indicates how many Spiders of the 
Curse you have destroyed so far.
When this icon is displayed 
next to the name of the area on
the Map Subscreen, there are no
more Spiders in that area.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

If you break the curse on my
family, we will make you very
rich...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Since you've destroyed  Spiders
of the Curse, the curse on me 
has been broken.
Thank you! Here is a token of my
appreciation! Please take it.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Thank you for saving my kids.
What? Me? Oh, that's OK...
You have already destroyed 
Spiders of the Curse so far, so...
that's fine...don't worry about me...

From here on, we'll be going
through some narrow passages!
If you take it slow, maybe you
can sneak up on some enemies.
Use (Z) Targeting to always look
in the proper direction. Set your
view so you can see down the next
corridor before you turn a corner.
Once your view is set, hold down
(Z) to sidestep around the corner.
That way you won't be surprised
by an enemy waiting in ambush.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Stand next to this block and grab
hold of it with (A). While holding
(A), you can push or pull it.
If you stand next to the block
and press (A) while pressing (+)
towards the block, you can climb
on top of it.
Pay attention to what the Action
Icon says!

That monster! It came out of the

I once heard a mysterious bird

Great! You're safe!
I knew I would hear from

I'm in the Forest Temple!
The forest spirits were calling
for help, so I went to check it
out...
But it's full of evil monsters!
Help me, Link!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Link...
At first, I didn't want to become 
the Sage of the Forest....
But I'm glad now.
Because I am helping you to save
Hyrule, Link!
Yes, I am!

If all six Sages come together, 
we can imprison Ganondorf, the 
King of Evil, in the Sacred Realm.
But, in order to make a perfect
seal, we need the seventh 
Sage.
Someone you know must be that
Sage, Link...
From now on, you must travel 
between past and future to
awaken the remaining Sages!
Keep up the good work,
Link!

View Point with (Z) Targeting
When you have no object to look
at, you can just look forward
with (Z).
Stop moving and then change the
direction you are facing, or hold
down (Z) for a little while.
This can help you get oriented in
the direction you want to face.
It's quite convenient!
If you hold down (Z), you can
walk sideways while facing 
straight ahead.
Walking sideways can be a very
important technique in dungeon
corridors. Turn around and try
doing this right now.

Switch Targeting

you can lock on to it.
If you press (Z) again, the lock
will either release or it will
transfer to the next object with
the © above it.
When you have many enemies in
your field of view and you want
to escape, press (Z) while holding
back on (+) to cancel targeting.
You can target the stones next to
this sign for practice!

____________________________________
Yahoo! Hi, Link!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Wow! A fairy!!
Finally, a fairy came to you,
Link!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I'll wait for you here.
Get going! Go see the Great 
Deku Tree!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

(A) by the stone, pick it up!
(A) by the stone, pick it up!
Mean old Mido...he made me pick 
up the rocks in front of his house.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh, you have a fairy now?!
That's great, Link!
What?
You've been called by the
Great Deku Tree? What an honor!
He may give you a special gift!
Tee hee!
That's because the Great Deku 
Tree is our father, the forest
guardian, and he gave life to all 
of us Kokiri!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I wonder if the Great Deku Tree 
gave life to everything in the
forest, I mean in addition to us 
Kokiri?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hey, let's work on some moves!
To jump sideways while (Z) 
Targeting, press (A) as you move
right or left.
To do a backflip while (Z) 
Targeting, press (A) as you move
backwards.
To do a roll attack while (Z) 
Targeting, press (A) as you move
forward. While you roll, you can
avoid damage.
If you have your sword ready while
(Z) Targeting, you can do a jump 
attack by pressing (A)! A jump 
attack does double damage!
You can use (Z) Targeting on the
stone next to me, so let's 
practice!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You're not allowed to leave the 
forest!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The Great Deku Tree said that if
a Kokiri leaves the woods, he or 
she will die!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That meanie, Mido, made me cut 
the grass at Saria's house.
Mido told Saria he would do it so
she would like him, but I'm the one
doing all the work!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You and Saria are close friends,
so will you help me cut the 
grass?
I'll let you keep anything that 
you find while cutting it.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Yes, yes! That's how you use a
fairy!
It's so great that you finally have
a fairy partner!
I'll teach you how to talk to 
people using your fairy!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
When a fairy flies near a person 
or thing, press (Z) to look in that
direction.
If you use (Z) Targeting, you can 
talk to people from a distance, 
like we're doing now.
When you have nothing that you
can target, you can press (Z) just
to look forward.
Try it!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh, a fairy finally came to you!
Now you have a lot to learn!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Wow! That's great news!
I'm so happy for you!
Now you're a true Kokiri,
Link!

summoned you?
It's quite an honor to talk to the
Great Deku Tree!

Oh... Navi...
Thou hast returned...
Link...
Welcome...
Listen carefully to what I, the
Deku Tree, am about to tell thee...
Thy slumber these past moons 
must have been restless, and
full of nightmares...
As the servants of evil gain
strength, a vile climate pervades
the land and causes nightmares
to those sensitive to it...
Verily, thou hast felt it...
Link... 
The time has come to test thy
courage...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Then enter, brave 
Link, and thou too, 
Navi...
Navi the fairy...  
Thou must aid Link...
And Link...When Navi

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Perhaps you do not yet have 
confidence in your abilities...
Return to the Kokiri Forest to
learn the skills of combat...
When thou art ready, return here 
and speak with me by using (Z)...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________

some new skills is in the Forest

Ow-ow-ow! Forgive me, master!
If I give you a clue, will you let

When you jump off a high cliff,
if you hold (+) forward, you will
roll on the ground when you land 
and won't get hurt from the fall.
I can't guarantee it will
work, though, if the cliff is really,
really high, heh heh!
Well, try it if you are feeling
bold!
Wah ha hah!

Go back to the Mask Shop

come out of your own pocket.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Did you know that if you hold ©
forward when you jump off a cliff,
you'll roll when you land. This will
absorb the shock of your landing.

still get hurt...

Well done, Link...

You have a cool Slingshot, huh?
You know what's cool about it?
You can aim while holding down
(C) and shoot by releasing the

If you have the Slingshot ready,
you can use (Z) Targeting to 
shoot while moving.... Did you 
know that?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

No, Link...
Thou must know my time is short...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Now...listen carefully...
A wicked man of the desert 
cast this dreadful curse upon me...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

If you're looking for Saria, she's
in the Lost Woods, as usual.
Don't tell me you don't know 
where that is! The entrance is up
on the cliff overlooking the

I know you'll get lost! Don't 
worry, you'll just end up back at
the entrance!
Harumph!

Thou must never allow the desert

Thou must never suffer that man,

That evil man who cast the death 
curse upon me and sapped my 
power...
Because of that curse, my end is
nigh...
Though your valiant efforts to 
break the curse were successful, 
I was doomed before you started...
Yes, I will pass away soon...
But do not grieve for me...
I have been able to tell you of 
these important matters...
This is Hyrule's final hope...

Hey you! "Mr. No Fairy!"
What's your business with the

Without a fairy, you're not

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

If you want to pass through here,
you should at least equip a sword

Sheesh!

What?!
Mido won't let you go to see 
the Great Deku Tree?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

You can buy a shield at the shop,
but there is only one sword
hidden somewhere in the forest.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Shoot! How did you get to be the

There are three kinds of items:
Equipment items, (C) Button items
and Quest items.
Equipment items are things like 
the sword, shield and clothes 
that are effective when you equip
them.
(C) Button items can be set to

Hi, mister! You can't use a

Do you know Saria, mister?
That's weird...

Where has Mido gone during such
an emergency?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I see. You didn't have any 
problems entering the forest, 
mister...
Did the meanies out there bother
you much? Before the Great Deku 
Tree died, you wouldn't see things
like that around here....
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Have you been travelling around
much, mister?
Have you ever met a boy named 
Link?
Mido said that the Great Deku 
Tree withered because that boy
did something wrong to it...
Only Saria defended 
Link--until she left.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Maybe we misunderstood....
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Haven't I seen you somewhere
before, mister?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Mister, do you know a boy 
named Link?
He left the forest and never
came back...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I wonder if Link will 
ever return?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

It would be awesome to be big 
like you, mister! I really want to
be big like you!
I want to be big and strong and 
beat up the Deku Scrubs, but...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
We Kokiri won't ever get bigger 
for the rest of our lives...
What a bummer!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Why is that fairy following you 
around? You're not one of us!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What are you? Though you wear 
Kokirish clothing, you can't
fool me!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I promised Saria I would never
let anybody go through here.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hi there! I'm the Deku Tree 
sprout!
Because you and Saria broke the
curse on the Forest Temple, I 
can grow and flourish!
Thanks a lot!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hey, have you seen your old
friends? None of them recognized
you with your grown-up body, did
they?
That's because the Kokiri never
grow up! Even after seven years,
they're still kids!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You must be wondering why only
you have grown up!
Well, as you might have already 
guessed, you are not a Kokiri!
You are actually a Hylian!
I am happy to finally reveal this
secret to you!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Some time ago, before the King of
Hyrule unified this country, there
was a fierce war in our world.
One day, to escape from the fires
of the war, a Hylian mother and 
her baby boy entered this 
forbidden forest.
The mother was gravely injured...
Her only choice was to entrust
the child to the Deku Tree, the 
guardian spirit of the forest.
The Deku Tree could sense that
this was a child of destiny, whose
fate would affect the entire world,
so he took him into the forest.
After the mother passed away, 
the baby was raised as a Kokiri.
And now, finally, the day of 
destiny has come!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You are a Hylian, and were
always bound to leave this forest.
And now...
You have learned your own 
destiny...
So you know what you must do...
That's right...
You must save the land of 
Hyrule!
Now, Link, break the 
curses on all of the Temples,
and return peace to Hyrule!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That melody?!
Saria plays that song all the 
time!
You...Do you know Saria?
That song...
Saria taught that song only 
to her friends...

____________________________________
When I see you... 
I don't know why, but I remember...
him...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I have you now!
In this gap between dreams and 
reality, soon all that will remain
of you will be your dead body!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Thank you...
Because of you, I could awaken as

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh...I see...
Saria won't ever come back...
But...I...I made a promise to 
Saria...
If Link came back, I 
would be sure to tell him that 
Saria had been waiting for him...
Because 
Saria...really...
liked...

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

will come back...

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

I wonder if Saria will come back...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Din...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

With her strong flaming arms, she

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Nayru...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

departed for the heavens.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

And golden sacred triangles
remained at the point where the
goddesses left the world.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Since then, the sacred triangles
have become the basis of our

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Hello, Link!
Wake up!
The Great Deku Tree wants
to talk to you!
Link, get up!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Hey! C'mon!
Can Hyrule's destiny really depend
on such a lazy boy?

Come hither....
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Oh, Navi the fairy...
Listen to my words, the words of 
the Deku Tree...
Dost thou sense it?
The climate of evil descending 
upon this realm...
Malevolent forces even now are
mustering to attack our land
of Hyrule...
For so long, the Kokiri Forest, the
source of life, has stood as a 
barrier, deterring outsiders and 
maintaining the order of the world...
But...before this tremendous evil
power, even my power is as 
nothing...
It seems the time has come for 
the boy without a fairy to begin 
his journey...
The youth whose destiny it is to
lead Hyrule to the path of 
justice and truth...
Navi...go now! Find our young
friend and guide him to me...
I do not have much time left.
Fly, Navi, fly! The fate of the
forest, nay, the world, depends
upon thee!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Thank you very much!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

I've been waiting for you,
Link!
This is the Sacred Forest Meadow.
It's my secret place!
I feel...
This place will be very 
important for both of us someday.
That's what I feel.
If you play the Ocarina here, you 
can talk with the spirits in the 
forest.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Would you like to play the 
Ocarina with me?
Yes
Don't do it
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
OK, try to follow along with the
melody I will play.
Are you ready?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Huh?!
How boring!
C'mon! Play along!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Great! Great!
Please don't forget this song!
Do you promise?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
When you want to hear my voice,
play Saria's Song. You can talk 
with me anytime...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Are you taking good care of 
my Ocarina?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Cool!
You're great!  You scored
three perfect bull's-eyes!
I have to give a neat present
to such a wonderful person!
Please take it!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Mido might know something about
Saria's whereabouts.
I think Mido is sulking in one of

No response. He's sleeping.

Cojiro?  Why?
Normally only a nice guy like me 
can tame you...
Which means...

You... 
You must be a nice guy!
Must be!
You must be!!
Please Mr. Nice Guy! Please!
Deliver this stuff to the old
hag in the potion shop in Kakariko
Village!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

This will disappear if you take
too long, so you gotta hurry!
OK
I can't
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh, yeah. That's it!
You aren't a nice guy after all!!
Get away from me!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Saria wanted to see you...
Did she find you already?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hurry up, nice guy!
Before it disappears, deliver it
to that old wench....
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That guy isn't here anymore.
Anybody who comes into the 
forest will be lost.
Everybody will become a Stalfos.
Everybody, Stalfos.
So, he's not here anymore.
Only his saw is left. Hee hee.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

That medicine is made of

Heh heh!

Hi! Do you think my face is kind

It's just not very unusual...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Let's play again sometime!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Follow along with our song on 
your Ocarina. We'll lead you 
into it.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That was quite a nice session.
As a token of our friendship, 
please take this.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hey, over here!
Hoo hoo!
Link...Good to see you
again! Listen to this!
Hoot hoot....
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
After going through the Lost 
Woods, you will come upon the 
Sacred Forest Meadow.
That is a sacred place where few
people have ever walked.
Shhhh...What's that?
I can hear a mysterious tune...
You should listen for that tune
too...
Hoo hoo ho!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Do you want to hear what I said
again?
Yes
No
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If you are courageous, you
will make it through the forest
just fine...
Just follow your ears and listen
to the sounds coming from the
forest! 
Hoot hoot!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hoo hoo!
Did you learn an Ocarina song
from Saria?
That melody seems to have some
mysterious power.
There may be some other 
mysterious songs like this that
you can learn in Hyrule.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If you hold the Ocarina with (C)
where a melody is necessary, a 
musical staff will appear.
I recommend that you play a song
you know.
I also suggest that you play even
when a score is not displayed. 
Just like this:
Hoo hoo hoo hoot hoot hoot!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Do you want to hear what I
said again?
Yes
No
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Melodies you have learned 
will be recorded on the Quest 
Status Subscreen. You should 
memorize those melodies.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Ohh...That bum! I don't know why 
he's always so mean to everyone!
What he said is true, though.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The forest...strange things have
been happening here lately...
You need to be ready for anything.
You'd better find a weapon!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
All right! You win! In return,
I will sell you Deku Seeds!
30 pieces   40 Rupees they are!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I give up! If you let me go,
I will sell you a Deku Shield! It's
50 Rupees!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I quit! If you let me go, I'll sell 
you some Bombs!
5 pieces   40 Rupees they are!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Knock it off! Leave me alone, and 
I will sell you Arrows!
30 pieces   70 Rupees they are!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
All right! You win! If you spare 
me, I will sell you a Red Potion 
for 40 Rupees!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

All right! You win! Spare me, and
I will sell you a Green Potion for 
40 Rupees!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What?! You've got a fairy?!
Say what? The Great Deku Tree
actually summoned you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Whaaaaaaat?!
Why would he summon you and not 
the great Mido?
This isn't funny...
I don't believe it!
You aren't even fully equipped
yet!
How do you think you're going to 
help the Great Deku Tree without
both a sword and shield ready?
What? You're right, I don't have
my equipment ready, but...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Eh, what's that?!
Oh, you have a Deku Shield...
And what's THAT?!
Is that the Kokiri Sword?!
GOOD GRIEF!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Well, even with all that stuff, 
a wimp is still a wimp, huh?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I lost! Now I'll sell you a Deku 
Stick for 15 Rupees.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I lost! Now I'll sell you Deku 
Nuts if you leave me alone.
5 pieces   20 Rupees they are.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
And also...
I'm sorry for being mean to him.
Tell him that, too.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hee hee hee!
You came all the way up here?
You're a real man!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Look! Isn't this view pretty?
Change your viewpoint with (^),
so you can look around the forest

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What did you do to the Great
Deku Tree?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If you want to go to the Lost 
Woods, you'd better equip the
right gear!
Hee hee!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
All my young Deku Scrub brothers
say...
You have a horrible face!
But don't worry! We will reward
you with many Deku Nuts.
Of course, we will also enable 
you to carry more of them!
Abracadabra...
Alakazaaaam!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I surrender!
To make your quest easier,
I can enable you to pick up more
Deku Sticks!
But, it'll cost you 40 Rupees!

Thank you very much for the 
other day... I haven't even asked
you your name yet...

........

Really?
Link!
That's what I thought!
You're the fairy boy from the
forest! That was years ago!
Do you remember me?
You do? I was sure it was you
because Epona remembered you!
Oh, I have to tell you about
Mr. Ingo...
He was afraid that the Evil King
might find out that Epona had
been taken away...It really upset
him!
But one day, all of a sudden, he
went back to being a normal, nice
person!
Now my dad is coming back...I
can't believe it, but peace is
returning to this ranch!
It's all because of you! I
owe you so much!
Thank you! Thank you,
Link!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

How is Epona doing?
If you play Epona's Song with
your Ocarina, she will surely
come to you.
Please come back to the ranch
whenever you want to train 
Epona!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Epona looks great!
It looks like you were able
to tame her, too!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
How about trying your skill with
Epona on an obstacle course?
I'll time you for two laps.
It's pretty challenging. If you
miss jumping a fence in the 
proper order, you'll fail.
How about it?
Do you want to try? 
Let's go
Don't do it
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Well, your time was .
You have to train harder!
Remember, you don't need to 
accelerate to jump over low 
fences, but you do need to go
fast to jump the high fences!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Link...can you hear me?
It's me, Zelda...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Moooooooooo!
What a nice song...
It reminds me of the pasture...
That song makes me feel so good,
I can produce a lot of milk!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Have some of my refreshing and 
nutritious milk!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Link, when you hold
this Ocarina in your hand...
I won't be around anymore...
I wanted to wait for you, but I
couldn't delay any longer...
At least I could leave you the 
Ocarina and this melody...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Now, Link.
Play this melody in front of the
altar in the Temple of Time.
You must protect the Triforce!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Wha-ha-ha-hah! Do you think 
you're in disguise, Mr. Hero?
Oh?
Is that a "Kee...something..."
character mask? I heard he's 
very popular recently?
He's my boy's favorite. That
"Kee...something..." mask...
If you don't mind...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Will you sell it to me?

Yes
No way
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

I won't give up! I have plenty of

Huh? Yeah, I'm awake!
What?
Hey, it's you! Welcome!
Awww... That was rough!
Malon yelled at me for a long

You took care of us, so I'm proud 
to give you this milk! You can 
keep the bottle for yourself.

Hmmm... OK...

Wah ha ha ha hah!
What kind of funny game has our
Princess come up with now?!
OK, OK, all right.  You can go

Wah hah ha ha hah!

You and Epona are a great

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
By the way, Mr. Hero...
If you're going to climb 
Death Mountain, you should equip
a proper shield! It is an active
volcano, after all!
If you go back to Hyrule Castle
Town Market, you should check
out the Bazaar. They sell the
shield you need there.
Tell 'em I sent you and they
should give you a special 
discount!
If you think you're good to go
already, don't worry about it.
Now, I'd like to ask a favor of 
you. No, I don't expect you to do
it just because of the great tip I
just gave you! I'm just asking!
Have you been to the Happy
Mask Shop that just opened in
the Hyrule Castle Town Market?
Everyone is talking about it!
My little boy pesters me for a 
popular mask, but I don't have
time to go there...
So, could you go and get the
mask for me next time you are in
the Market? If you don't feel like
it, that's OK, but...
Well, I have no choice, this is my 
job...
...sigh...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I wish I could go to the mask
shop in town to buy a present for
my kid...

Wha ha ha hah!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

You sold the 10-Rupee mask for 
15 Rupees. You earned a little
profit.
Let's go to the Mask Shop and
pay back the mask price of 
10 Rupees.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Little kids can't go on the 
"Heart-Pounding Gravedigging
Tour" described on the sign.
Since I can't do that, I'm just 
imitating Dampé the gravekeeper 
all day.
But with my cute face, I'm not
heart-pounding at all, am I?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Gyaah! It's Dampé the 
gravekeeper!
???
Oh, it's just a mask. I get a 
different kind of fright from that
mask than I get from Dampé...
Will you give that mask to me?

Yes
No way
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I really do have some money, you
know.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Hey! Time's up, young man!
You only paid 10 Rupees!
You've played around long enough!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
With this mask, I'll be just like 
Dampé! 
Here's my money!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You sold the 30-Rupee mask to a
kid for full price?! 
And he didn't mind paying at all!
Let's go back to the mask shop to
pay 30 Rupees for the mask. 
You can get the new mask 
model, too.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I'm gonna dig and dig! 
Just like Dampé!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

In old times, I heard there were 
many wild rabbits in the land 
of Hyrule. Not anymore, though, 
because of excessive hunting.
I want to become a rabbit...
Listen to the wind with 
those ears, hop across the ground
with those legs...
Even if I can only pretend.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I bet with those long ears you 
can hear the voices... 
Oh, these are genuine rabbit
ears from the animal of legend!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I don't care how expensive it is!
Please sell it to me!
Yes
No way
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That's not the answer I wanted to 
hear!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

It's a 50-Rupee mask, but he paid
you a crazy amount of money for
it--more money than you can 
count!
Go back to the Mask Shop and 
pay back just 50 Rupees of this
money.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

So, you think you can protect
them from me...
You've got guts, kid.

There are some people in Kakariko
spreading rumors that I cheated
Talon out of the ranch, but...
Don't be ridiculous!
That guy Talon was weak!
I, the hard-working Ingo, poured 
so much energy into this place!
I don't want any strangers like
you saying anything bad about me!
Listen. The great Ganondorf
recognized my obvious talents and
gave the ranch to me!
I will raise a fine horse and
win recognition from the great 
Ganondorf!
Say, young man, do you want
to ride one of my fine horses?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Don't ride

Do you want to hear how to ride?

Listen
Don't listen
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Approach the horse quietly and 
stand by its side. Press (A) to 
mount up.
Use the (+) to make it run. 
Once it starts running, press
(A) to tap it with the whip. 
It will speed up!
When you want to jump over a
fence, accelerate and hit it
head on!
If you try to jump over a fence 
at an angle, the horse won't like
it, and it won't jump.
After the horse comes to a

You're getting better!
How about a little race with me?
One lap around the corral with
that horse.
Let's make a little wager, say
50 Rupees?
Do it
Don't do it
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hey hey... What's the matter?
Don't you have even 50 Rupees?!
I don't want to race with someone
so poor!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Sh-shoooot!
If the great Ganondorf found out
about this humiliation...
Hey, you!!  How about another
race!  If you win...
You can keep...the horse!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What's up with that horse?!
Is that Epona?
How did you tame that wild horse
right under my nose?!
I was going to present that horse
to the great Ganondorf... But I bet
it on the race and lost! Shooot!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hah ha hah!
As I promised, I'll give the 
horse to you...
However...
I'll never let you leave this ranch!

Hee hee hee... Too bad for you!
I get your 50 Rupees.

What?  What are you doing 
hanging around here?
You little weirdo!
I am Ingo and I mind the ranch.
I've been working at this ranch 
for a long time for that lazy
bum, Talon.
Today, for example, he's gone
somewhere for a delivery and he 
hasn't come back yet!
So, I'm doing all the work around
here.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh well...It's tough to be a
working man.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Hey, your clothes! They're...
different...
You're not from around here, 
are you?

Ohh... You're a fairy boy from 
the forest! My name is Malon!
My dad owns Lon Lon Ranch!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Dad went to the castle to deliver
some milk, and he hasn't come
back yet...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Are you going to the castle,
fairy boy?
Would you mind finding my dad?
He must have fallen asleep 
somewhere around the castle. 
What a thing for an adult to do!
Tee hee!
Oh yeah, if you'll look for him, I'll 
give this to you.
I've been incubating this
egg very carefully...
Tee hee!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Set the egg to (C) to incubate it.
Hee hee!
My dad is really troublesome,
for an adult, isn't he?!
Hee hee!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I can't believe that I, the great
Ingo, am working on this dump of
a ranch!
Because the owner is so lazy, I
always have to do all the work 
around here!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I, the hard-working Ingo, should be 
in charge, not that lazy bum, 
Talon!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Oh, it's the fairy boy again!
I heard that you found my dad!
How did you like the castle? Did
you see the Princess? Hee hee!
Dad came home in a hurry after
you found him. Hee hee!
Oh yeah, I have to introduce you
to my friend, fairy boy!
She's this horse. Her name is
Epona. Isn't she cute?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

It seems like Epona is afraid of 
you, fairy boy...

you, fairy boy.

Oh...a visitor!
It's been a long time since we've
had a visitor here...
Where did you come from?
Since Ganondorf came, people in
the Castle Town have gone, places
have been ruined, and monsters
are wandering everywhere.
Mr. Ingo is just using the ranch
to gain Ganondorf's favor...
Everyone seems to be turning evil...
But Dad...
He was kicked out of the ranch
by Mr. Ingo...
If I disobey Mr. Ingo, he will treat
the horses so badly...
So...
There's nothing I can do...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

You...
Do you know my mother's song?
Everyone really liked that song...
My dad... Even Mr. Ingo...
But...since Ganondorf appeared,
Mr. Ingo has changed completely.
I can remember the good old days
only while I sing the song. Also...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Go straight this way and you will

Head south from here to reach

If you go west, you'll find

Well, you're free to go anywhere

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Those plants growing over there 
are Bomb Flowers. They are
"mining plants" that grow only on
this mountain.
The flower's fruit is the raw 
material for bombs.
But a non-Goron amateur should 
never pick the Bomb Flowers' 
fruit!
They usually grow only in dark 
places, so Bomb Flowers that grow
in a place like this are extremely
rare.

If you have the Goron's Bracelet,
even a little kid like you could
easily pick it with (A).
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Did you see the cavern on your 
way here? That is the Dodongo's 
Cavern.
Because the light inside is very 
dim, the Bomb Flowers, a plant 
unique to this mountain, grow like
crazy in there!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh?
We don't get many visitors way
up here. Where are you from?
The forest?
What's a "forest"?
Eh?
It's where a lot of "trees" and 
"plants" grow?
Now I'm even more confused! 
Nothing grows around here besides
the Bomb Flowers...
We don't have "seeds" or "nuts"
around here either.
Even Deku Sticks are very scarce
around here!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

I sealed the entrance because I

I'm sorry...
That Bomb is just for display. 
I'm sold out of real ones.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Why did you stop me?
Don't stop me here!
You can't stop my wild rolling!
This wild rolling is the only way
to relieve my stress!
Now stand in awe of my wild, wild
rolling!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
All right! I'll give you this
in praise of your courage!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Thank you! Let me express my joy
with more wild rolling!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Oh...I'm so hungry...
Everyone feels faint from hunger
because of the food shortage in 
this town. We are in danger of 
extinction!
It's all because we can't enter
our quarry, the Dodongo's Cavern.
We Gorons live on a diet of 
rocks...
And the most delicious and 
nutritious rocks around are found 
in the Dodongo's Cavern! But that 
seems like ancient history now...
We've become such gourmets that 
we can't stand to eat rocks from
anywhere else!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Sigh... I want to eat the top
sirloin rocks from the Dodongo's 
Cavern!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hey!
It's dangerous for a little kid like
you to come out here. You might 
fall down!
If I'm not mistaken, you came out
here to eat the red stone!
Well, too bad! It's not here!
What? That's not why you're
here?
You're looking for a "Spiritual
Stone?" You must mean that 
delicious-looking red stone
that was once displayed here!
I was so hungry that I thought
it would be OK to just give it one
tiny little lick...so I snuck out
here. But, it was already gone!
I think Big Brother took it away.
He always says that everyone
is after that red stone!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Big Brother has shut himself up in
his room saying,
"I will wait in here for the 
Royal Family's messenger!"
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I'm so hungry that I can't think
about anything but food!
Ask Big Brother about complicated
things.
If he's in a bad mood, he'll 
probably get mad at you...it
can be pretty scary. But...
I know his SECRET.
He may not look like the type,
but Big Brother loves to dance!
If he gets in a rhythm, he'll surely...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I remember Big Brother used to
always listen to the music that
comes from the forest...
Ah yes, the good old days...
That music makes me feel
nostalgic, too...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What the heck! Who are you?!
When I heard the song of the
Royal Family, I expected their 
messenger had arrived, but...
you're just a little kid!
Has Darunia, the big boss of
the Gorons, really lost so much
status to be treated like this
by his Sworn Brother, the King?
Now, I'm REALLY angry!
Get out of my face, now!
Are you asking why I'm in such a
bad mood right now?
Ancient creatures have 
infested the Dodongo's Cavern!
We've had a poor harvest of our
special crop, Bomb Flowers!
Starvation and hunger because
of the rock shortage!
But...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
This is a Goron problem!
We don't need any help from
strangers!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Heeey!! What a nice tune!
Just like that, my depression is
all gone! Something just came 
over me! I suddenly wanted to
dance like crazy!
I am Darunia!
I'm the big boss of the Gorons!
Was there something you wanted 
to ask me about?
What?
You want the Spiritual Stone of
Fire, too?
The Spiritual Stone of Fire, also
known as the Goron's Ruby, is our
race's hidden treasure....
But hold on--I'm not going to give
it to you that easily.
If you want it so badly...
Why don't you go destroy the 
monsters inside of the Dodongo's 
Cavern and prove you're a real man?
That way, everybody will be 
happy again! If you do it, I 
will give you anything you want,
even the Spiritual Stone!
I have something for you. I'm not
really giving you this in
return for anything, but take it
anyway.
If you wear this, even a little 
fella like you can pick a Bomb 
Flower using (A).
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Destroy the monsters in the
Dodongo's Cavern and become a 
real man! Then, we can talk about
the Spiritual Stone!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hey, Brother, play that tune
again sometime soon!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
No matter how many times I hear 
that song, it doesn't get old!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Well, that's not quite what I 
was looking for...
I wanted to hear...a tune...
something...um...from outside 
the mountains...something...
green...natural...
That's the kind of music I want 
to hear...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh, now we can enter the cavern.
You're so smart!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I know a trick to conserve sticks!
If you light a stick on fire, it will 
burn to ashes. Press (A) to put it
away before it completely burns!
By the way, I hid a stick
somewhere...
Hehehee...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
It's me, Darunia!
Well done!
Thanks to you, we can once again
eat the delicious rocks from the
Dodongo's Cavern until our 
stomachs burst!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I'm so hungry that I can't think
about anything but food!
"Spiritual Stone?"
That red stone that was lighting
up our city?
Big Brother Darunia took it
away. Then, he shut himself up in
his room and won't come out.
Since then, it feels like all
the lights in the city have gone 
out... Everyone seems so...
depressed...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I want you to bring fire from Big
Brother's room back here.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Oh, I see...
We should have thrown the 
Bomb from the cliff...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You are incredible, destroying 
the Dodongos! Do you mind if I 
call you Big Brother?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Thanks to you, we're all OK!
Why don't you buy some Bombs 
now?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You know, I'm so grateful to you.
When I have a kid, I will name it
after you!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

If you want to hear more Goron
gossip, head up to our city!
Goron City is just a little
way up the trail. It won't take
much longer to get there, even
on foot.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You pick the Bomb Flowers with 
(A). Press (A) again to set it.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
When all the torches on this floor
are lit, Goron City is really lively!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Are you going to clear out the 
Dodongos? It's a Goron problem,
though. You're a nosey little kid,
aren't you?!
Well, of course we'll be happy if 
you fix it so we can get all the
Bombs we want, like we used to...
Just let me warn you, though...
Dodongos are scary creatures! 
They'll eat ANYTHING!!
So watch yourself, and don't 
get eaten!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I already told you!
We're out of Bombs!
Ohhh... I'm so hungry!

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

How was Big Brother?
I see...
By the way, do you know the
music coming from deep inside of
this tunnel? We all like this music!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I won't let you get me! 
You probably work for Ganondorf!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
How could you do this to me?
You, you're Ganondorf's servant!
Hear my name and tremble!
I am Link! 
Hero of the Gorons!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What?
Your name is also
Link?
Then you must be the legendary
Dodongo Buster and Hero, 
Link!
My dad is Darunia...
Do you remember him?
Dad named me Link
after you, because you're so 
brave!
It's a cool name!
I really like it!
Link, you're a hero to 
us Gorons! 
I'm so glad to meet you!
Please give me your autograph!
Sign it:
"To my friend, 
Link of the Gorons"
Oh...
I guess it's not a good time
to ask you for this...
Please help everyone!
My dad, Darunia, went to the Fire
Temple. A dragon is inside!
If we don't hurry up, even my dad
will be eaten by the dragon!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

You'd better try to calm him down
if you can...
Maybe he will calm down if you 
talk to him?
What do you want to ask him?

About the dragon
About the Gorons
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
A long time ago there was an
evil dragon named Volvagia living 
in this mountain.
That dragon was very scary!
He ate Gorons!
Using a huge hammer, the hero of
the Gorons... BOOOM!
Destroyed it just like that. This is 
a myth from long ago, but it's 
true!
I know, because my dad is a
descendant of the hero!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Everybody was taken to the 
Fire Temple...
While my dad was out...
Ganondorf's followers came and
took them all away!
All of them will be eaten by
Volvagia!
Dad said that Ganondorf has
revived Volvagia...
As a warning to those who might
oppose him, Ganondorf is going to
feed them all to Volvagia!
Dad went to the Fire Temple all
by himself to try to save 
everyone...
Please help, Link!
I'll give you this heat-resistant
tunic!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Dad told me not to let anybody 
follow him to the temple, but...
Only you, Link, can
save everyone!
I'm sure that the shop owner, who
is hiding somewhere right now, will
also help you!
Now, I'll tell you about the secret
passage to the Fire Temple!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Try to move the statue inside
Dad's room!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Who's there?  Is that you,
Link...?
Oh, it really is Link!
You've grown so big since I last
saw you!
I want to have a man-to-man talk
with you, but now's not the time.
Ganondorf is causing trouble on
Death Mountain again!
He has revived the evil, ancient
dragon Volvagia!
On top of that, he is going to
feed my people to that evil dragon
as a warning to other races that
might resist him...
If that fire-breathing dragon
escapes from the mountain, all of
Hyrule will become a burning
wasteland!
I will go on ahead to try to seal
up the evil dragon...
I'm concerned, though, because I
don't have the legendary hammer...
But I have no choice.
Link...I'm asking you to
do this as my Sworn Brother...
While I'm trying to deal with the
dragon, please save my people!
The prisoners' cells are in the
opposite direction.
I'm counting on you, 
Link!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

I'm saved!
Thank you!
Here, take this!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

it any longer...
Get out of here!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Thank you, Brother!
I really appreciate what you
did. I thank you on behalf of
the entire Goron race!
You turned out to be a real man,
just as I thought you would!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Don't forget...
Now you and I are true Brothers!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

It is something that grows over

A feeling in the heart that

This song is dedicated to the 
power of the heart...
Listen to the Bolero of Fire...

here!

What a wild adventure! It will
make an incredible story...
I can't believe that the Dodongos
suddenly appeared in such great 
numbers!
And that big rock blocking the 
cave...
All this trouble must have been
caused by that Gerudo thief, 
Ganondorf!
He said, 
"Give me the Spiritual Stone!
Only then will I open the cave 
for you!"
You, on the other hand, risked 
your life for us...

You've done well to come all the
way up here, Link. 
This is the summit of the sacred
Death Mountain! Hoot!
It is said that the clouds 
surrounding this peak reflect the
condition of Death Mountain. When
they look normal, it is at peace.
Climbing all the way up here
just proves how smart you are!
Now I want to see you make
another smart move...
The Great Fairy lives on this
mountaintop, and she will give
you a new skill! She is the leader
of the fairies, you know. Hoo!
I will perch here and wait for you.
When you're ready to go back
down, I can help you! 
Now, get going!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hoo hoot!
Well, it looks like you've grown
up a little from the Great Fairy's
power...
But you still don't really look like
the hero who will save Hyrule. At
least not yet!
If you are going back down the
mountain, I can lend you a wing.
Come here and grab my talons!
And hold on tight! Hoo hooooooot!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

They say that a beautiful fairy
lives on top of Death Mountain!
Don't you want to see her?

won't you?
You should go see the Great Fairy

I'll tell you a secret for
saving me!
In this temple, there are doors
that fall down when you try to 
open them. When one of these
doors starts to fall, move!
If you use a sample of the
Goron "special crop," you can
break it...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Let me tell you a secret as
a reward for releasing me!
When you are on fire, you can put
it out by swinging your sword, or
by rolling forward... Did you know
that?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Here's a tip for rescuing me!
Somewhere in this temple, you're
sure to meet up with some 
creatures that dance as they
attack. Arrows won't hurt them!
Looks like you might need some of
the Goron "special crop!" That's
all I have to tell you!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I'll tell you a secret for
saving me!
There are switches in this temple
that you have to cut to activate.
But, you can also use the Goron
"special crop" to do the job.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

I'll tell you a secret for

If you find a place that you can
see on the map, but can't reach,
try playing your Ocarina!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I'll tell you a secret for
saving me!
In order to get into the room
where Darunia went, you have to
do something about the pillar
stuck in the ceiling.
Find a path that leads to a room
above the ceiling right away!

I'll tell you a secret for
saving me!
A door is hidden inside the statue
at the entrance to this temple.
But, the Goron "special crop" won't
work on it... Don't you have
anything stronger?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Here's a secret for saving me!
A wall that you can destroy with
the Goron's "special crop" will
sound different than a regular
wall if you hit it with your sword.

This way!  Hoo hoo!
I wonder what Saria is doing now?
How about going back to the

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

What are you doing? You've come 
a long way to get up here...
You should look at the Map 
Subscreen sometimes.
Link, this is a beautiful
lake full of pure, clear water.
At the lake bottom there is
a Water Temple used to worship 
the water spirits. The Zoras are
guardians of the temple. Hoo hoo.
The Zoras come from Zora's
Domain in northeast Hyrule. An
aquatic race, they are longtime
allies of Hyrule's Royal Family.
I heard that only the Royal Family
of Hyrule can enter Zora's Domain...
Hoo hoo!
I'm on my way back to the castle.
If you want to come with me, hold
on to my talons!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

It looks like there is something
already inside this bottle.
It's a letter:
"Help me.
I'm waiting for you inside
Lord Jabu-Jabu's belly.

PS: Don't tell my father!"
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Who are you?
We are the Zoras, the proud

So...you say you have some 
connection with Hyrule's Royal
Family... 
Well, what do you want from us?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
We are good at diving!
How about you?
If you want to be a master diver,
try the diving game at the top 
of the waterfall!
Have you tried it already?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Zora's Fountain is the

Lord Jabu-Jabu lives in the

Have you seen Lord Jabu-Jabu?

Yes
No
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

According to the "Legend of Zora,"
the act of offering a fish to Lord

Oh, that's not good.
Everybody who comes around here 
should see Lord Jabu-Jabu at 
least once!
Zora's Fountain is just beyond 
King Zora's throne. That is where
Lord Jabu-Jabu swims. But...
unless you have King Zora's
permission, you can't go to 
Zora's Fountain.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

We haven't found Princess Ruto
even though some of us have

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

If you find any clues to
Princess Ruto's whereabouts,
will you show them to King Zora?

Oh--I've come back to life!
Was it you who saved me?
Don't be nervous!
It looks like you have a hard time
breathing underwater.
As an expression of my gratitude,
I grant you this tunic. With this,
you won't choke underwater.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Princess Ruto has gone to the

come back... I'm so worried...again!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ooh...
This is... well... hmmm...
Hmmm... Eye drops...
You might say we have them,
you might say we don't...
We do have the ingredients.
If you take the ingredients to the
doctor at the lake laboratory, he
can make the drops for you.
But you need to deliver them
fresh...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Can you make it before they
spoil?
Yes
No
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Then you think they'll spoil 
before you can get there?
It's not that far if you make the

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Hoot hoot!
Link, you look like 
you're getting more comfortable
in your role as adventurer.
I think Princess Zelda is

You already have the Goron's Ruby,
don't you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Hello there, son. I'm researching 
the process of making medicine by 
mixing Lake Hylia's water with 
various unusual compounds.
Perhaps you've met that old lady 
from the potion shop...she is like 
a student of mine...
Ho ho ho!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Oh, wow!
I haven't seen an Eyeball Frog

Oh, my dear, sweet Princess Ruto...
Where has she gone?
I'm so worried...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ho, this letter! 
It's from Princess Ruto!!
Hmmm...Let's see...
She's inside Lord Jabu-Jabu?
That's not possible!
Our guardian god, Lord Jabu-Jabu,
would never eat my dear Princess
Ruto!
But since that stranger, Ganondorf,
came here, Lord Jabu-Jabu has 
been a little green around the
gills...
The evidence seems clear.
Of course, you'll go find Ruto.
You can pass through here to the 
altar of Lord Jabu-Jabu.
I'll keep this letter. You keep the 
bottle it was in. Take it 
respectfully!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Ohhh, I'm revived...
Was it you who saved me?
Don't be so nervous!
I will give you a Zora Tunic as
a token of my thanks. If you have
this, you can... What?!
You already have one? You're 
ready for anything, aren't you!
With my heartfelt thanks...how 
about a KISS?! What? You don't 
want it?! Oh well...
If you don't want my rewards, you
can listen to my troubles...

Well, anyway, you saved me, so I

I want that Spiritual Stone.
Nothing really...

We Zoras all respect the great

The grand King Zora has a

She's also a wild tomboy, and it
seems like she's always causing
the King a lot of trouble!

Hoo hoo! Looks like you've gotten
bigger and stronger already,
Link!
Just ahead lies Zora's Domain. 
The Zoras serve Hyrule's Royal

Spiritual Stone of Water...
Well, maybe.
Huh?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Her most precious possession?
You don't know what she's talking

This ice is created by an evil
curse... The monster in the Water
Temple is the source of the curse.
Unless you shut off the source, 
this ice will never melt....
If you have courage enough to

the Zoras, I will teach you the 
melody that leads to the temple.

If you came here to meet the

This is all there is...
With one exception, the Zoras

I managed to rescue the Zora

she left to head for the Water 
Temple...

Link?!
You're Link, aren't
you?
It's me, your fiancée, Ruto!
Princess of the Zoras!
I never forgot the vows we
made to each other seven years 
ago!
You're a terrible man to have 
kept me waiting for these seven
long years...
But now is not the time to talk 
about love...
I'm sure you've already seen it!
Zora's Domain--totally frozen!
A young man named Sheik saved 
me from under the ice...
But my father and the other 
Zoras have not
...yet...

I want to save them all!
I want to save Zora's Domain!
You! You have to help me!
This is a request from me, the
woman who is going to be your
wife!
Link, you have to 
help me destroy the evil monster
in the Temple, OK?!
Inside the Water Temple, there are 
three places where you can 
change the water level.
I'll lead the way.
Follow me, quickly!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

I'd never ask anyone to do such a

"Letter in a Bottle?"  I have
no idea what you're talking about!
My father is worried about me?
I don't care!
Anyway, I can't go home right now.
And you... Get out of here!
Understand?!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

I told you to go away!
I'm OK. I've been going inside
Lord Jabu-Jabu's belly since I was
little, but...
Lord Jabu-Jabu is very strange 
today...
There are electrified jellyfish and
strange holes around...
On top of that, my precious stone 
was...but...
That's none of your business!
Anyway...
You! Go home now!
Understand?!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

OK, listen up!
Walk up to the water's edge and
press (Z) to look at a fish.
While looking at a fish, you can 
cast your line with (B). Press (A)
to brake the line.
When the lure drops into the 
water, you can wiggle it with (+).
If you're a novice, you can also
use (B).
Reel in your lure with (A). Hold 
down (A) and (R) to reel it in 
faster.
If you feel a hit, press (A) and
(+) down to set the hook.
After that, reel it in with (A).
Do you understand?

Yes

I am one of the ghostly composer

All the people in this village are
born to serve the Royal Family of
Hyrule.
We brothers also served the Royal 
Family, and were assigned to 
study the hereditary mystic 
powers of the family.
Though we never could figure out 
the power of the Triforce,
we had almost completed our 
study of controlling time with the 
tones of ocarinas.
Uh, I mean...
Actually, we did complete that 
study!
We would have been famous, if 
that hateful Ganondorf had not
tried to steal our results.
We could never let him reap the 
fruits of our research!
That's why we gave our lives to 
protect the secret.

Hmm... Since you may have some

tale.
Back then, people called us great
composers because of the many 
musical masterpieces we wrote.
But we brothers were not just 
composers.
We had a mission to analyze the
mysterious powers of Hyrule's
Royal Family.
Our names would be a part of 
Hyrule's history if we could 
complete our research!
We kept our study extremely 
secret until we completed it.

was studying a different song, one

If you were really sent by a

We inscribed it on the royal

We Sheikah have served the

On that day seven years ago,
Ganondorf suddenly attacked...
and Hyrule Castle surrendered
after a short time.
Ganondorf's target was one of
the keys to the Sacred Realm...the
hidden treasure of the Royal
Family...The Ocarina of Time!
My duty bound me to take Zelda 
out of Ganondorf's reach.
When last I saw you, as we made
our escape from the castle, you
were just a lad...
Now I see that you have become 
a fine hero...

I am the boss of the carpenters
that Impa hired to improve this
village and make it into a true
city!
But young men these days don't
have any ambition...
Do you know what I mean, kid?
My workers are just running
aimlessly around the village, and
they're not making any progress
at all...
Even my own son doesn't have a 
job, and he just wanders around
all day!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
They're all worthless, I tell you!!

Look at that poor girl over there.
She works so hard taking care of 
her chickens, even though touching
them gives her goose bumps...
What a trooper! I would really 
like to help her! I've just been
feeling so charitable these days!
Don't you feel that way, too?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

The Princess is safe now.

Soon, you'll meet Princess Zelda
face-to-face, and she will explain
everything...
That is when we, the six Wise 
Ones, will seal up the Evil King
and return peace to Hyrule.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hehehe, young man...
You were very quick to be able
to keep up with me! Hehehe!
As a reward, I'm going to give
you my treasure. It's called the
Hookshot!
Its spring-loaded chain will pull
you to any spot where its hook
sticks. Doesn't that sound cool?
I'm sure it will help you!
I live here now, so come back
again sometime. I'll give you
something cool!
One more thing! Be careful on
your way back!
Heheheh....
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

You're back, young man...
Was the present I gave to you
fun and useful?

I believe Impa has gone to the 
Shadow Temple to seal it again,
but...she will be in danger without 
any help!
Link!
Impa is one of the six Sages.
Destroy the evil shadow spirit and
save Impa!
There is an entrance to the 
Shadow Temple beneath the 
graveyard behind this village.
The only thing I can do for you is
teach you the melody that will
lead you to the Shadow Temple...
This is the melody that will draw
you into the infinite darkness 
that absorbs even time... Listen to 
this, the Nocturne of Shadow!!

Go around! Go around and around

I'm a music man who loves

I'm trying to come up with a

Grrrrrrrrr!
I'll never forget what happened on
that day, seven years ago!
Grrrrrrrrr!
It's all that Ocarina kid's fault!
Next time he comes around here,
I'm gonna mess him up!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What?! You've got an ocarina!!
What the heck!
That reminds me of that time,
seven years ago!
Back then a mean kid came here 
and played a strange song. It 
messed up this windmill!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What should I do!?
My Cuccos have all flown away!
You, little boy, please!
Please help me bring them back to 
this pen!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

My Cuccos have run away!
Please help me bring the other

Thank you for finding my Cuccos.
I have allergies, so I get 
goose bumps when I touch them.
For helping me, I will give this
to you. It's fine glass, and should
be useful. Please take good
care of it!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Hey, what are you doing?!
Now go round them up or pay for 
them!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Please don't tease my Cuccos!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I bred a new type of miniature 
Cucco! I call it the Pocket 
Cucco! I don't get goose bumps
from this baby.
Cuccos are very good at 
getting lazy, late-risers out of bed.
Haven't you heard of them 
before?
It makes them very happy to crow:
CUCCKOOOO!
especially when it wakes up a 
very heavy sleeper!
However, my Cucco is not entirely
happy right now...
You..., 
You look like you're good at 
handling Cuccos.
Here, take this egg.
After the Cucco hatches, bring it 
back to me after a while, and I'll 
check out its mood.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

What do you think? 
Will you try?
Yes
No
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Oh, too bad...were you pecked by
a Cucco when you were little?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Heh heh heh, young man!
Are you fast on your feet?
I may not look like it, but I'm 
confident in my speed!
Let's have a race! 
Follow me if you dare!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Please make my Cucco happy!
OK?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh, your Cucco looks pretty 
happy! He must have awakened an
extremely lazy guy!
You're a good Cucco Keeper!
I'll give you a rare, valuable
Cucco, if you're interested...
Its name is Cojiro, and it used to
be my brother's Cucco. Its
blue body is quite charming.
It's so cute!
Since my brother has gone, 
it's strange, but Cojiro has 
stopped crowing.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Do you want to keep Cojiro?

Yes
No
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

It looks as if you really like that
other Cucco. OK, you can keep it
for a while.

Death Mountain is back to normal!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

watching Death Mountain from

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Hey! Kid, do you always enter
other people's houses without 
permission? Didn't your parents 
teach you any manners?
Oh well.
Did you see a lady behind this 
house? She's going through hard 
times.
Oh well.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If that lady asks you about 
chickens, you should listen to her.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Is visiting other people's houses 
at this late hour your idea of 
fun? You must not have had a 
good upbringing.
Oh well.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That lady takes care of chickens,
but she is, in fact, allergic to 
them.
Oh well.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hey! Young man! A grown boy
like you entering a person's house
without permission?! I want to
talk to your parents!
Oh well.
This isn't my house anyway.
This is the great Impa's house!
The great Impa has gone to the
graveyard to seal up the 
humongous creature there.
Since Ganondorf appeared, many 
monsters have been sighted 
around here.
Only the great Impa has kept 
peace in our village. You have to
remember that, young man!
Oh well.
Speaking of the great Impa, she
hasn't come back yet. I wonder 
what happened to her?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I heard that the ghost of the
gravekeeper often appears in the 
graveyard behind this village...
But, no big deal.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hi, boy! Is this the first time
you've visited this village?
A great woman, Impa, opened up
this village to us poor folk.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Well, make yourself at home.
The food isn't ready yet, though.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

The great Impa is not here. Did
something happen to her?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

over there. I bet even someone
like him has had his share of
troubles in the past...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Hello there, son.
Zelda's attendant, the great Impa,
opened this village to the common
people.
We have only a small population 
now, but someday this place will 
be as lively as Hyrule Castle 
Town! Oh, yes! It will!
Climb up the stairs at the north
end of the village to find the trail
that leads up Death Mountain.
But you need the King's permission
to actually go up the mountain.

Oh, I get it. You're testing your

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

I've seen your fine work. To get 
past the guards here, you must 
have good thieving skills.
I used to think that all men, 
besides the great Ganondorf, were 
useless...but now that I've seen
you, I don't think so anymore!
The exalted Nabooru, our leader, 
put me in charge of this fortress.
Nabooru is the second-in-command
to the great Ganondorf, King of 
the Gerudo Thieves.
Her headquarters are in the Spirit
Temple, which is at the end of the
desert.
Say, you must want to become 
one of us, eh?
All right, then!
You're in from now on!
Take this. With it, you will
have free access to all areas of
the fortress!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
From now on, you're free to come
and go as you please through the 
gate to the desert.
You'll find the Spirit Temple, 
where the exalted Nabooru lives,
out there in the desert.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Stupid Kid!
Get in there and keep quiet!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I have no idea where you 
come from, but you must have a
lot of guts to make it past all
the guards around here!
All of my fellow carpenters
are imprisoned somewhere in here.
If you can get us out of here,
we'll repay the favor somehow!
But be careful! There're sure
to be Gerudo guards somewhere 

around here....

Woo! Watch out!

Hey, rookie!
Are you going into the desert?
I'll open this gate for you, but...
You can't cross the desert 
unless you pass the two trials.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The first trial is...the River of 
Sand! You can't walk across this
river! After you cross it, follow
the flags we placed there.
The second trial is...the Phantom
Guide!
Those without eyes that can see
the truth will only find themselves
returning here.
You are going anyway, aren't you?
I won't stop you...
Go ahead!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Why did you come all the

you may as well make the best of 
things!

I haven't seen you around, kid...
What do you want?
To see the temple
Looking for the Sages
Nothing, really
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You're just a kid! The temple is
no place for kids!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

A Sage? I don't know anyone
like that.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You have nothing to do? What 
good timing! Can you do me a 
favor, kid?
Wait a second, I want to ask you
first--you wouldn't happen to be
one of Ganondorf's...
followers...would you?

What if I am?
I hate Ganondorf!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Wha-ha-ha!
Don't try to act cool, kid.
I was just asking!
A kid like you could never be
one of Ganondorf's followers!
Well, let's cut to the chase...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Uh-huh!
You've got guts.
I think I like you.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
First of all, let me introduce 
myself. I'm Nabooru of the Gerudo.
I'm a lone wolf thief.
But don't get me wrong!
Though we're both thieves, I'm 
completely different from
Ganondorf.
With his followers, he stole
from women and children, and he 
even killed people!
A kid like you may not know this, 
but the Gerudo race consists only
of women. Only one man is born
every hundred years...
Even though our laws say that
lone male Gerudo must become
King of the Gerudo, I'll never
bow to such an evil man!
By the way, what is your name, 
kid?
Link?!
What kind of name is that?
Well...anyway...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I want to ask you a favor...
Will you go through this tiny hole
and get a treasure that's inside?
The treasure is the Silver
Gauntlets. If you equip them, you
can easily push and pull very 
heavy things!
No, no, no, kid! Don't even think
about taking this treasure for 
yourself!
The Silver Gauntlets won't fit a
little kid like you if you try to 
equip them! I want you to be a 
good boy and give them to me!
Ganondorf and his minions are
using the Spirit Temple as a 
hideout.
Only the Silver Gauntlets will 
allow me to sneak deep into the
temple.
Once there, I'm going to steal all
the treasure inside and mess up
their plans!
How about it? Will you do it?

Yes
No
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Thanks, kid!
You and I, let's give Ganondorf
and his followers a big surprise,
shall we?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If you can successfully get the 
Silver Gauntlets...
I'll do something great for you!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Well, what did I expect?
After all, you're just a kid!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Hey! Where are you taking me?!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ho ho ho!
Looks like someone is here, Koume.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hee hee hee!
Looks like it, Kotake!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What an outrageous fellow he is,
to intrude so boldly into our 
Temple...
Ho ho ho!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
We should teach this outrageous
fellow a lesson!
Hee hee hee!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

She's just a little girl,
but she commands a lot of 
respect among the Gerudo, Kotake...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Maybe we should make her work
for the great Ganondorf for
a little while longer!
Ho ho ho!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Then we should brainwash her
again!
Hee hee hee!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Kid, let me thank you.
Heheheh...look what the little
kid has become in the past seven
years--a competent swordsman!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

If only I knew you would become

I should have kept the promise
I made back then...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

It's a very important thing to me.
Let's have a competition later!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Link...see you again!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
By the way...
I really messed up...
I was brainwashed by those old
witches and used by Ganondorf to
do his evil will...
But isn't it funny? That a person
like me could turn out to be the
Sage of Spirit!
And now, I'm going to fight
them as one of the six Sages!
Heh heh...
I'm going to pay them back for
what they did to me!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Kid...
No...
Link, the Hero of Time!
Instead of keeping the promise I

Get out of here! Now!

Hey, newcomer! This is our 
horseback archery field.
After a lot of hard practice and
training, we finally have the skill
to hit the bull's-eye while riding
like the wind!
When you finally learn how to ride
a horse, you should come back
and try it. It's a dangerous sport,
but it's fun!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hey newcomer, you have a fine 
horse!
I don't know where you stole 
it from, but...
OK, how about challenging this 
horseback archery?
Once the horse starts galloping,
shoot the targets with your
arrows. 
Let's see how many points you 
can score. You get 20 arrows.
If you can score 1,000 points, I
will give you something good!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Do you want to try again for
20 Rupees?
Yes
No
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hey, rookie!
You're looking good!
Show me your skill again!
You should set a new goal of
1,500 points and try again!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What? Do you want to try again?
Looks like you have some
potential!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I'll be darned! You are a true 
master!
I will give you an item suitable
for a master.
This quiver is very important to 
me. I want you to have it.
Take good care of it, OK?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
 points...Hmm...
Wha-ha-ha! You have plenty of 
room for improvement!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Fantastic!
You are the ultimate master!
I will give you this item.
Once you have this equipment, the
only thing left to improve is
yourself!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
 points...
Quite impressive!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Look at that stupid kid!
He came on his own to offer 
himself as a sacrifice to the
great Ganondorf...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
With my flame, I will burn him to
the bone!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

This time, we'll get serious,
right Kotake?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What?
Hey, Koume, what is that above
your head?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I don't know, but you have one
over your head too, Kotake!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

But I'm only 400 years old!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Did you come here to save me? 
Oh, that's just swell! I'm Ichiro
the carpenter.
We were really interested in 
joining their all-female group, but 
they locked us up like this just
because we're men!
We don't care about the Gerudo 
anymore! They're so rude!
Three of my fellows have also 
been captured, so please help 
them escape, too!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
You're a cute kid! Thank you for
coming to save me! I'm Jiro, the 
carpenter.
These women are so scary! I'd
rather work as a carpenter than
join them!
I can't wait to say good-bye to
this place! Two of my buddies 
are still being held prisoner. Will
you please get them out, too?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Thanks, boy! You're fantastic!
I'm Sabooro, the carpenter.
Have you seen our boss, boy?
He's probably worried about me!
I have to get back to him 
immediately!
One more of our workers is still
a prisoner. Please save him!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I was afraid you were going to 
forget about me! Now I'm free!
Thanks! I'm Shiro the carpenter.
For rescuing me, I'll tell you
something interesting about the
desert that I overheard the
Gerudos talking about.
They said, "In order to cross the
Haunted Wasteland, you'll need the
'eye of truth.' The Colossus is on
the far side of the wasteland..."
OK, now I'm going back to my
tent near Gerudo Valley, so, 
drop by sometime. You may find 
something helpful there! Byeee!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

building a bridge over the valley

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

I am a master craftsman. Those
Gerudo thieves...they broke the

I want to fix it, but all of my

They said working as carpenters
isn't cool, and they went to the

thieves...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Hey, you! If you're going to the

out what my workers are doing
over there?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hey, I heard you saved my men.
When they returned, we built this
bridge.
Look at this! 
Isn't it a fine bridge?
They may be wimpy carpenters, 
but once they all got together,
they got the job done.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

killer instinct, too.
Now that the bridge over Gerudo
Valley is complete, I'm looking for
a challenger to have a 
commemorative race against.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The best time to go from here to 
the bridge in the Lost Woods was
.  That's my record.
Will you challenge my record?

Yes
No
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Excellent!
Then...
You go first.
I'll give you a headstart.
Now! 
Go ahead.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Heh heh heh.
You'll never discover your
killer instinct with that
kind of attitude.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Well, not perfect, but you
have some guts! Unfortunately,
you never can beat me. Your
record is a thing of the past.
Your time was , wasn't it?
That was close, but I beat you
by one second!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Heh heh heh.
Please. 
Go ahead.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh, looks like you quit the race.
Heh heh heh. I bet you had almost 
rediscovered your killer instinct!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Heh heh.
You don't have enough killer
instinct yet.
Just train harder.
Good-bye, then!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Huff...puff...huff...

Huff...huff...whew!
You did quite well!
But you couldn't beat me!
Your time was , but I
just beat you by one second!

You'll have to challenge me
again sometime!
Huff...huff...
Good-bye, then!

I came here to run through the

Though I want to go back to 
Hyrule Field, the bridge is...well,
you can see it from here. So I'm
stuck here, inside this tent.
I don't think I can accept your
challenge right now.
Heh heh!

Welcome to Hyrule Castle Town.
It's a peaceful, prosperous town.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Kids shouldn't be wandering around
town at nighttime! Stay indoors
until morning!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Man, I am SO bored...
Things would sure be more
interesting if there were more...
troubles in the world...
Hey, that's just between you and
me, OK?
Anyway, maybe we can let off 
some steam by breaking these 
jars.
Stand near a jar and press (A) to
lift it. Press (A) again to toss it!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That's great!
I forgot to tell you...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
There's a lot going on in the 
castle right now. I can't allow
even a dog to get into the 
castle!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Unnngh...are you the boy from 
the forest...?
I-I-I've finally met you...
I-I-I have something to t-t-tell
you...
Ganondorf, the Gerudo King of
Thieves, betrayed our King...
Zelda's nanny, Impa, sensed danger
and escaped from the castle with
our Princess...
I tried to stop Ganondorf's men
from chasing them...but...
The Princess was...waiting for a
boy from the forest...that's you...
She wanted to give something to
the boy...
If you received it from the 
Princess, 
hurry...to the Temple of
Time....

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
He's not moving anymore....
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Can you see the man with the 
evil eyes?
That is Ganondorf, the leader of 
the Gerudos. They hail from the 
desert far to the west.
Though he swears allegiance to my 
father, I am sure he is not 
sincere.
The dark clouds that covered 
Hyrule in my dream...
They must symbolize that man!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Geh heh heh! Excellent work!
As I thought, you held the keys
to the Door of Time!
You have led me to the gates of
the Sacred Realm...
Yes, I owe it all to you, kid!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Please! If you don't hurry,
he'll be gone!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Please...with (C)...
Please sell me the contents of a
bottle...
Please...with (C)...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

What a strange shop! 
I wonder when it'll be open for

but it still seems weird!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

It seems like it's taking forever
for dawn to come...
The view of Hyrule Castle in 
the morning sun is so fantastic!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

To save the forest girl, you need
another skill... 
Head to Kakariko Village!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

It looks like you have the

The forest girl is waiting for your

If you plan on scaling Death

Kid, have you been to 
Lon Lon Ranch?
Their milk is delicious!
There are many horses there, and
the young daughter of the ranch
owner is cute!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
To get to Lon Lon Ranch, after
you leave town, head due south
across the field. You should visit
the ranch at least once!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I wanted to see Princess Zelda!
I avoided the guards...
Swam through the moat...
I was almost there when they
caught me!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I found a small drain hole on the
right side of the castle that I
thought I could sneak into, but I
got stuck there.

Ahem! Hrrrm!

What?!
You're looking for the guy from
Lon Lon Ranch?
Hmm, maybe...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I saw a guy with a shabby-looking
beard delivering some boxes to 
the castle.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Do you know about the Temple 
of Time that we have in the 
northeast part of town?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Legends say that the Temple of
Time is the entrance to the 
Sacred Realm...
Did you know that?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Wha-ha-ha! What a crazy guy!
Can you believe this guy was 
crazy enough to try to sneak into
the castle to see Princess Zelda?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
All because of this idiot, they've 
tightened security at the castle.
Wha-ha-hah!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

I made a lot of money!
Maybe I should go look for
more things to sell!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

I know! I should go to Lake Hylia!
Many things float down the river
and end up there!
Hah hah!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Hey, forest boy! This is the city
of Hyrule! Take your time and
enjoy the sights!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If you came here to see Hyrule
Castle, take the street on your

If you want to see the back 
alleys of the town, take the
street to the left.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ohh...
You are...so handsome...
Just like the King of Hyrule...
Hee hee...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Ohh...
You are...
more beautiful...
than Princess Zelda...
Ohh...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Have you heard the legend of the
"Shadow Folk"?
They are the Sheikah...the shadows
of the Hylians.
They say they swore allegiance to
the King of Hyrule and guarded
the Royal Family.
But with the long peace, no one
has seen a Sheikah around here 
for a long time.
However...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I heard there is one Sheikah 
woman living in the castle...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
So you say you want to see
Princess Zelda, eh?
You probably heard about her in
town and decided you had to meet
her... Well...
Go home! Get out of here!
The Princess would never grant an
audience to the likes of you!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Can't a person get a little shut-

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hello, and who might you be?
Yep, I'm Talon, the owner of Lon 
Lon Ranch.
I went to the castle to deliver
some milk, but I sat down here to
rest, and I guess I fell asleep...
What?!
Malon was looking for me?
I'm gonna catch it from her now!
I messed up bad, leaving Malon
behind to wait for me!
She's really gonna let me have it!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Hey you! Stop!
You, kid, over there!

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Do you have it? 

Yes
No
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Well, that's odd...
I thought you might be the one
from my dream...
You really don't have it?
Tell me the truth...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Just as I thought!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Please keep this a secret from

OK

C'mon...don't be a blabber-mouth!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

The legend goes like this...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The three goddesses hid the
Triforce containing the power of
the gods somewhere in Hyrule.
The power
to grant the wish of the one who
holds the Triforce in his hands.
If someone with a righteous heart
makes a wish, it will lead Hyrule
to a golden age of prosperity....
If someone with an evil mind has
his wish granted, the world will
be consumed by evil...That is what
has been told....
So, the ancient Sages built
the Temple of Time to protect the
Triforce from evil ones.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That's right... The Temple of Time
is the entrance through which you
can enter the Sacred Realm from
our world.
But the entrance is sealed with
a stone wall called the 
Door of Time.
And, in order to open the door,
it is said that you need to collect
three Spiritual Stones.
And another thing you need...is
the treasure that the Royal Family
keeps along with this legend...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh, I'm sorry. 
I'm not very good at storytelling...

Don't worry.
He doesn't have any idea what

Please!

OK
I don't believe you.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Thank you!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

My attendant will guide you out of
the castle. Don't be afraid to talk
to her.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The Spiritual Stone...
You finally found it!
It is said that the races that hold
the Spiritual Stones open their
minds only to one who knows the
melody of the Royal Family.
But you already know that, don't
you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hey, have you heard that
Princess Zelda sees prophetic 
visions in her dreams?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Huh? What? Shoo, kid! Shoo!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
There are three hollows and 
an inscription here....
Ye who owns 3 Spiritual Stones 
Stand with the Ocarina of Time
And play the Song of Time
That is how the inscription reads.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

C'mon, can't you make it any

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Hey, let go! It's mine!
I found it first!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hey, who bumped me?!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
We don't see a lot of Gerudos in
these parts...
Something fishy is going on!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Wasn't that Princess Zelda riding
on the white horse?!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I almost got kicked by that
black horse!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That guy riding on the black horse
must have been Ganondorf, who is
renowned as the Gerudo King of 
Thieves.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What happened?!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Look at that guy--he's so scared!
What a wimp!
Ha ha hah!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I have a feeling something
terrible is going to happen...
Maybe I should leave town soon.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Something happened in the castle!
Kid, you'd better be careful!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
With that key, proceed to the 
room ahead. Go, go!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The one riding on the white horse
holding the little girl...
Wasn't that a legendary Sheikah?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Link...
Wake up...
Link, the chosen one...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I am Rauru, one of the ancient
Sages...
Ages ago, we ancient Sages
built the Temple of Time to 
protect the entrance to the
Sacred Realm...
This is the Chamber of Sages, 
inside the Temple of Light...
The Temple of Light, situated in
the very center of the Sacred 
Realm, is the last stronghold 
against Ganondorf's evil forces.
The Master Sword--the evil-
destroying sword that you pulled
out of the Pedestal of Time--was 
the final key to the Sacred Realm.
Link...
Don't be alarmed...
Look at yourself...!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Look Link!
You're big now!!
You've grown up!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The Master Sword is a sacred
blade which evil ones may never
touch....
Only one worthy of the title of
"Hero of Time" can pull it from 
the Pedestal of Time....
However, you were too young to 
be the Hero of Time....
Therefore, your spirit was 
sealed here for seven years.
And now that you are old enough,
the time has come for you to
awaken as the Hero of Time!
Well, do you understand your 
destiny?
Yes
No
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Right, it looks like you are 
confused... Let me tell you 
again, from the beginning.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
But, remember...
Though you opened the Door of 
Time in the name of peace...
Ganondorf, the Gerudo King of
Thieves, used it to enter this 
forbidden Sacred Realm!
He obtained the Triforce from
the Temple of Light, and with its 
power, he became the King of Evil...
His evil power radiated from the
temples of Hyrule, and in seven
short years, it transformed Hyrule
into a world of monsters.
My power now has only little 
influence, even in this Sacred
Realm...
Namely, this Chamber of Sages.
But there is still hope...
The power of the Sages remains.
When the power of all the Sages
is awakened...
The Sages' Seals will contain
all the evil power in the void of 
the Realm...
I, Rauru, am one of the Sages...
And...
Your power to fight together with
the Sages makes you the 
Hero of Time!
The Hero of Time, chosen by the
Master Sword!
Keep my spirit with you...
And, find the power of the other
Sages and add their might to your
own!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Link...we're back in the
Temple of Time...
But have seven years really
passed?
It looks like you won't be
able to use some of the weapons
you found as a kid anymore...
Let's get out of here!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Heyyy, what...? 
What's wrong with loitering
around all day?
Huh, kid?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I've been waiting for you, 
Hero of Time...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
When evil rules all, an awakening
voice from the Sacred Realm will
call those destined to be Sages,
who dwell in the five temples.
One in a deep forest...
One on a high mountain...
One under a vast lake...
One within the house of the dead...
One inside a goddess of the sand...
Together with the Hero of Time, 
the awakened ones will bind the
evil and return the light of peace
to the world...
This is the legend of the temples
passed down by my people, the
Sheikah.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh, I'm sorry.
We're not open for business yet.
Please come back soon!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Use the Master Sword!
Destroy Ganon with the sacred
sword!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I have been waiting for you,
Link.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Link, the Hero of Time...
You have overcome many 
hardships and awakened six Sages.
And now you have a final
challenge, a showdown with 
Ganondorf, the King of Evil....
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If you would seek the sacred
triangle, listen well...
The resting place of the sacred
triangle, the Sacred Realm, is a
mirror that reflects what is
in the heart...
the heart of one who enters it...
If an evil heart, the Realm will
become full of evil; if pure,
the Realm will become a paradise.
The Triforce...the sacred triangle...
it is a balance that weighs the
three forces:
Power, Wisdom and Courage.
If the heart of the one who holds
the sacred triangle has all three
forces in balance, that one will
gain the True Force to govern all.
But, if that one's heart is not in
balance, the Triforce will separate
into three parts:
Power, Wisdom and Courage.
Only one part will remain for the
one who touched the Triforce...the
part representing the force that
one most believes in.
If that one seeks the True Force,
that one must acquire the two
lost parts.
Those two parts will be held
within others chosen by destiny,
who will bear the Triforce mark
on the backs of their hands.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Seven years ago, Ganondorf, the 
King of Thieves, used the door 
you opened in the Temple of Time
and entered the Sacred Realm.
But when he laid his hands on the
Triforce, the legend came true.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The one who holds the Triforce 
of Courage is...
You, Link!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
And the other, who holds the 
Triforce of Wisdom...
is the seventh Sage, who is
destined to be the leader of
them all...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
It is I, the Princess of Hyrule,
Zelda.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I apologize for meeting you in 
disguise, but it was necessary to
hide from the King of Evil. 
Please forgive me...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I saw you as I was escaping 
from the castle with my 
attendant, Impa.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
As long as you had the Ocarina 
in your possession, I thought 
Ganondorf could never enter the
Sacred Realm, but...
something I could never expect
happened...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That rumbling...It can't be!?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Princess Zelda...you foolish 
traitor!
I commend you for avoiding my 
pursuit for seven long years.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

If you want to rescue Zelda,
come to my castle!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Link...can you hear me?
It's Rauru, the Sage.
We six will gather our power to
create a bridge to the castle
where Ganondorf dwells...
The castle's keep, which is 
known as Ganon's Tower, is 
protected by six evil barriers.
Bring down the six barriers and
save Princess Zelda!!

You destroyed the wicked

But there are still other Sages
who need your help.
In order to awaken all the other
Sages, you must become even

You must travel over
mountains...
under water...
and even through time...

As I see you standing there
holding the mythical Master 
Sword, you really do look like the 
legendary Hero of Time...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
If you believe the legend, you
have no choice. You must look for
the five temples and awaken the
five Sages....
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
One Sage is waiting for the time
of awakening in the Forest Temple.
The Sage is a girl I am sure you
know...
Because of the evil power in the
temple, she cannot hear the
awakening call from the Sacred
Realm...
Unfortunately, equipped as you 
currently are, you cannot even
enter the temple...
But, if you believe what I'm saying,
you should head to Kakariko 
Village...
Do you understand, 
Link?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I thought I should entrust the
Ocarina to you... I thought that 
would be our best chance...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Before that...I have things I want 
to tell only to you. Please listen.
Another unknown legend of the 
Triforce passed down by the 
shadow folk, the Sheikahs....
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The Triforce separated into three 
parts. Only the Triforce of Power
remained in Ganondorf's hand.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The strength of the Triforce of
Power enabled him to become a
mighty, evil king, but his dark
ambitions were not satisfied.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
To gain complete mastery of the 
world, Ganondorf started looking
for those chosen by destiny to 
hold the two other Triforce parts.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
On that day, seven years ago,
Ganondorf attacked Hyrule Castle.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
After you opened the door of 
time, the Master Sword sealed you
away in the Sacred Realm...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Your spirit remained in the Sacred
Realm...and then the Triforce fell 
into Ganondorf's hands. He went
on to invade the Sacred Realm...
Ganondorf had become the Evil
King, and the Sacred Realm
became a world of evil. All of
this is an unfortunate coincidence.
I passed myself off as a Sheikah
and hoped that you would return.
I waited for seven years...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
And...now you are back. The 
dark age ruled by Ganondorf the
Evil King will end!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
The six Sages will open the sealed
door and lure Ganondorf back into
the Sacred Realm.
I will then seal the door to the 
Sacred Realm from this world.
Thus, Ganondorf the Evil King will
vanish from Hyrule.
Link...
In order to do this, I need your 
courage again. Please protect me
while I do my part.
And here is a weapon that can 
penetrate the Evil King's defenses...
The power given to the chosen 
ones...
The sacred Arrow of Light!!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
But you let your guard down...
I knew you would appear if I let
this kid wander around!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
My only mistake was to slightly
underestimate the power of this
kid...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
No...
It was not the kid's power I
misjudged, it was the power of
the Triforce of Courage!
But, with the Triforce of Wisdom
that Zelda has...
When I obtain these two Triforces...
Then, I will become the true
ruler of the world!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

The Ocarina of Time opened the
door. The Hero of Time, with the
Master Sword, descended here.

Hey, sonny, I'll tell you something
helpful...
I heard there is a mysterious

If you want to return to your

The time will come when you will
have to return here quickly...

You are a courageous boy...
You are heading out on a big, new 
adventure, aren't you?
My role in the Princess's dream
was to teach a melody to the one
from the forest.
This is an ancient melody passed 
down by the Royal Family.
I have played this song for 
Princess Zelda as a lullaby ever
since she was a baby...
There is mysterious power in 
these notes.
Now listen carefully...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

All the tragedy that has befallen
Hyrule was my doing...
I was so young...I could not
comprehend the consequences of 
trying to control the Sacred Realm.
I dragged you into it, too.
Now it is time for me to make up 
for my mistakes...
You must lay the Master Sword to 
rest and close the Door of Time...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
However, by doing this, the road
between times will be closed...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

give the Ocarina to me...
As a Sage, I can return you
to your original time with it.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

When peace returns to Hyrule...
It will be time for us to say 
good-bye...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Oh...you are quite an energetic
young man. You're brave and
handsome, too.
Heh heh heh...your name is
Link, isn't it.
Heh heh he...don't be surprised.
I can read people's minds.
If I looked as good as you, I
could run a different kind of 
business...heh he heh...
My shop is the only Ghost Shop
in Hyrule.
Because of the great Ganondorf, 
it is a fine time for a business 
like this...heh heh heh...
Oh...I can only hope the world 
gets even worse!
The ghosts, called Poes, are 
spirits of concentrated hatred 
that appear in the fields and 
graveyard. They hate the world!
Young man, if you catch a Poe, I
will pay a lot of money for it...
Heh heh hee!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Hey, young man. What's happening 
today? If you have a Poe, I will 
buy it.
Your card now has  points.
Come back again!
Heh heh heh!

Oh, you brought a Poe today!
Hmmmm!
Very interesting!
This is a Big Poe!
I'll buy it for 50 Rupees.
On top of that, I'll put 100
points on your card.
If you earn 1,000 points, you'll
be a happy man! Heh heh.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Wait a minute! WOW!
You have earned 1,000 points!
Young man, you are a genuine
Ghost Hunter!
Is that what you expected me to
say? Heh heh heh!
Because of you, I have extra
inventory of Big Poes, so this will
be the last time I can buy a 
ghost.
You're thinking about what I 
promised would happen when you
earned 1,000 points. Heh heh.
Don't worry, I didn't forget.
Just take this.

I had a dream...In the dream,
dark storm clouds were billowing

holding a green and shining stone,
followed by a fairy...

Speaking of rabbits, I saw a

Oooh, what a pretty lady!
But you're kind of short,
aren't you?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Well...I can't think of anything
funny to say...sorry, kid!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
A mask... When I was a little 
kid, I also wore masks around...
What? You say you can't imagine
me doing that?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ohhhh...I see...
It's an illusion...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Hey, kid, don't grow up to be

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

AAAAAAAAAAAH!
A GERUDO!!!!
Wha-? A mask?
Why do you have a mask 
like that?!

Sorry, I'm busy right now.

Hi, Keaton!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

How spooky!
There's a boy in Kakariko

mask like that!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hmm...well...don't you have any
other masks?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What a strange mask!
Hee hah haa!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hey kid! Can't you see we're

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Looks kind of strange...

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

should take off your mask!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

You idiot!
I don't know why I'm calling
you that, but...you are one!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Where did you get that?
What?
It's a mask?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Uh, leave me alone...
Can't you see I'm in a groove
right now?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
A mask is just like a musical 
instrument--it reflects the
character of its owner. I like
your originality, kid!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What a big head!
How'd you fit through that door?!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

I HATE foxes, sonny!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Now if that isn't the most
irritating face I've seen in
all my days, I don't know what
is!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hey, that's a fine face
you got there, sonny!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Have you got any complaints?
Speak up, then!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

I know I'm scary, but...man!
That's really scary!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Huh?! Wha--!
Oh, it's just a kid.
Don't scare me like that!
I may not look like it, but I'm a

Well, will you lookit the noggin on 
this kid! It's HUGE!
Mine is huge too, though...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Do you know what kind of
mask you're wearing...?
And you're still wearing it?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

I'm on duty now... 
If you want me to dig, don't

I forgot what those things are

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hey! It's a Keaton Mask!!
I asked my daddy to get me one,
too!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That's not very different from
Mr. Dampé, is it?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That doesn't look anything like
Mr. Dampé, huh?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hey, cool mask...but a little
scary, don't you think?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hey! That looks familiar...
I think I saw something like it
in the Lost Woods, no?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That makes me feel...happy...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Oh...uh...sniff...
That mask...
It makes me feel...sad...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hah! That mask won't do you any
good! You're just afraid of me,
the great Mido...aren't you?!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Waaaaah! What?
Hey, I'm not scared of you!
Just don't come any closer,
understand?!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hey, that's a cool mask.
I want it!
JUST KIDDING! Hah!
I don't want that stupid mask!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Wah hah ha hah!
That really suits you!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Waaaah!
I-I'm gonna tell Mido about 
this!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Yeeeeah!
I-I'm gonna tell Mido to beat
you up!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Whooooah!
Are you some kind of forest
ghost?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That's so cool!
Uh...don't tell Mido I said that!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What?!
You came back!
I can tell who you are, even
with that mask on!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I wonder what Mido would say if
he saw that?
I really would like to see his
reaction!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
I see...
You're going to scare Mido with
that mask, aren't you?!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hah hah hah!
What a funny face!
I bet Saria would think it's
pretty funny, too!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Tee hee hee!
A mask made of wood?
It looks like you're wearing
a shield on your face!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What a weird face!
Speaking of weird faces, one of
the forest kids was complaining
about his face...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What an enormous head you have!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Tee hee!
Where did you get that?
Outside the forest?
No way! I don't believe it!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hee hee!
Kind of funny, but it's not
really my style...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Right on! 
Wearing this mask makes me feel
really tough and scary!
Hee hee!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hee hee!
There sure are a lot of different
people in the world!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hee hee!
I don't need a new one...
I like the one I have, thanks!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Wow, that makes your head
look huge!
Hee hee!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What a cute little mouse!
What?
Oh, it's not a mouse?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
What are those floppy things
on your head?
Ears? That mask makes you look
like you have four ears!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
It must be exciting to sneak
past the guards while wearing
that mask!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hi, fairy boy!
What?
You think you're in disguise?
But it's so obvious who you are!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Wow!
What big eyes you have!
Gorons are so cute, aren't they!

Yer... Kin-ton!
Ain't that right?!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
That's a scary one, ain't it?
Almost as scary as...Ingo!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Hey, that reminds me of my wife...
On second thought, it doesn't...
It doesn't look like her at all!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

YAAAWWN...
I'm kinda tired right now...
Show it to me later...

Can't you see I'm busy?!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Humph!
It's fine to play like that when 
you're a kid, but just wait until
you grow up! Work, work, work!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
YEOW!
Humph. It's just a mask...
Scram, kid! Get out of here!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Heh heh heh...
Well, that cheered me up a little,
kid.
Thanks!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Hmmm... Let's see...
Yes, I'm quite sure of it...
That was manufactured from a 
plank from a coffin. Yes, it was!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ahhh...yes. Let's see...
Very fine craftsmanship.
But I don't think it would make
a good ingredient for my medicine.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Very interesting! A Goron!
Speaking of Gorons, I wonder
how my old friend, Biggoron of
Death Mountain, is doing?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Very unusual construction...
I don't think it's water soluble,
so it wouldn't make a good 
ingredient for my medicines...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Chomp chomp chomp...
OK, OK, a mask.
Do you want to buy some beans?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Nope, I don't want to buy it.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Nope, it's not my style.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Red hair...tan skin...
I've seen people like that before...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Yeah, right.
You look a little small for a
Zora...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
____________________________________
Ho ho ho!
You Hylians...you are such silly
creatures!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

That face...it gives me the chills...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Talk about a nostalgia trip!
That reminds me of my childhood
friend, Biggoron!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

I don't think that's funny at all.
Are you mocking me?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Don't do that...
It's embarrassing me!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

All right! You actually decided

Are you actually ready to marry
me now?
